### 🕯️ The Manifesto
In a network flooded by synthetic intelligence, trust requires proof of biology. However, we believe you shouldn't have to trade your face, your iris, or your government ID to prove you are human.

**0xHuman** verifies the *act* of humanity, not the *actor*. We validate your existence through trust and physical entropy, not biometric surveillance.

### ⚙️ Core Mechanics

#### 1. The Human Chain (Uplink / Downlink)
We are replacing the centralized authority with a biological blockchain of trust.
* **Uplink:** The node that validates you.
* **Downlink:** The node you are responsible for.
* **The Link:** A permanent, on-chain bond. If a Downlink is proven to be a bot, their Uplink faces economic penalties. This creates a self-policing network where reputation has financial weight.

#### 2. Sovereign Verification (Method Agnostic)
The protocol does not dictate *how* verification occurs, only the economic consequences of a false one.
* **Dynamic Validation:** The specific proof of humanity is established between peers. This variability renders standardized AI attacks ineffective.
* **Privacy First:** Verification happens off-protocol (Signal, P2P, In-person). 0xHuman only records the settlement (The Signature).
* **Anti-Abuse:** We implement a **"Right to Exit"** logic. Candidates can unilaterally reject an assigned Uplink and request a re-roll without penalty, preventing coercion or stalling.

#### 3. Permissionless Access
Anyone can acquire the token ($0xH). Only those who stake value ("Vital Bond") and pass the verification challenge receive the **0xPassport** (SBT).

### 🛠 Architecture

* **0xPassport:** ERC-5192 Non-transferable Identity Token.
* **Vault:** Time-locked staking contract for Vital Bonds.
* **Graph Protocol:** On-chain mapping of Uplink/Downlink relationships.
